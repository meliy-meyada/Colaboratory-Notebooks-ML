| 1. | [Dog breed Prediction](https://github.com/meliy-meyada/Colaboratory-Notebooks-ML/blob/main/ML-Notebooks/Dog_breed_Predictions.ipynb) | Convolutional Neural Network capable of identifying the breed of a dog in a supplied image. |
| 2. | [Traffic Sign Classification](https://github.com/meliy-meyada/Colaboratory-Notebooks-ML/blob/main/ML-Notebooks/TF_Traffic_Sign_Classification.ipynb) | Convolutional Neural Network to build train and test a traffic sign classification model.  Using tensorflow and keras. It is a multiclass classification problem. |

After extracting the text we will apply some basic functions of OpenCV on that text to enhance it and to get more accurate results. |
| 4. | [Plant Deseases Prediction](https://github.com/meliy-meyada/Colaboratory-Notebooks-ML/blob/main/ML-Notebooks/Plant_Deseases_Prediction.ipynb) | Convolutional Neural Network which will be able to predict whether a plant is suffering from a disease.|
| 5. | [Vehicle Detect Counts](https://github.com/meliy-meyada/Colaboratory-Notebooks-ML/blob/main/ML-Notebooks/Vehicle_Detect_Counts.ipynb) | Detecting and counting vehicles in a given image or a video. |
| 6. | [Face Swap](https://github.com/meliy-meyada/Colaboratory-Notebooks-ML/blob/main/ML-Notebooks/Face_Swap.ipynb) | Extract faces of human-beings from a given image. We will use a pretrained model to extract landmarks from the faces. |
| 7. | [Bird Species Prediction](https://github.com/meliy-meyada/Colaboratory-Notebooks-ML/blob/main/ML-Notebooks/Bird_Species_Prediction.ipynb) | Convolutional Neural Network which will be able to predict species of the bird. Use different layers and other hyperparameters for building, training and testing this multiclass classifictaion model. |
| 8. | [Intel Image Classification](https://github.com/meliy-meyada/Colaboratory-Notebooks-ML/blob/main/ML-Notebooks/Intel_Image_Classification.ipynb) | Convolutional neural network and train it on this images. This is a multi class classification problem and use Keras. |
| 9. | [Language Translation using IBM Watson](https://github.com/meliy-meyada/Colaboratory-Notebooks-ML/blob/main/ML-Notebooks/Language_Translation_using_IBM_Watson.ipynb) | Python will be used to capture the text, after which it will be sent to the IBM cloud to be translated into the chosen language. Watson AI will then be used to turn the translated text into a speech, and the file will then be output. |
| 10. | [Laptop Price Predictor](https://github.com/meliy-meyada/Colaboratory-Notebooks-ML/blob/main/ML-Notebooks/Laptop_Price_Predictor.ipynb) | Price variations and laptop types Prediction. |
| 11. | [Course Recommendation System](https://github.com/meliy-meyada/Colaboratory-Notebooks-ML/blob/main/ML-Notebooks/Course_Recommendation_System.ipynb) | Course Recommendation System using Udemy Dataset. Cosine and Linear Similarity. |

| 13. | [IPL Win Probability Predictor](https://github.com/meliy-meyada/Colaboratory-Notebooks-ML/blob/main/ML-Notebooks/IPL_Win_Probability_Predictor.ipynb) |  Indian Premier League (IPL) Win Probability Predictor. |
| 14. | [Book Genre Prediction](https://github.com/meliy-meyada/Colaboratory-Notebooks-ML/blob/main/ML-Notebooks/Book_Genre_Prediction.ipynb) | Book generate Predictions. |
| 15. | [Sentiment LG](https://github.com/meliy-meyada/Colaboratory-Notebooks-ML/blob/main/ML-Notebooks/Sentiment_LG.ipynb) | Sentiment analysis of Logistic Regression. |
| 16. | [Attrition Rate](https://github.com/meliy-meyada/Colaboratory-Notebooks-ML/blob/main/ML-Notebooks/Attrition_Rate.ipynb) | Employee Attrition Rate Prediction. |
| 17. | [Pokemon](https://github.com/meliy-meyada/Colaboratory-Notebooks-ML/blob/main/ML-Notebooks/Pokemon.ipynb) | Pokemon for Data Mining and Machine Learning. |
| 18. | [Cat vs Dogs](https://github.com/meliy-meyada/Colaboratory-Notebooks-ML/blob/main/ML-Notebooks/Cat_vs_Dogs.ipynb) | The project classification cat an dog using the ImageDataGenerator class from keras.preprocessing.image to load and preprocess images for training the model. |
| 19. | [Shopping Intentions](https://github.com/meliy-meyada/Colaboratory-Notebooks-ML/blob/main/ML-Notebooks/Shopping_Intentions.ipynb) | "Shopping Intentions" is a machine learning project that aims to predict whether an online shopper will complete a purchase on an e-commerce website. |
| 20. | [Gender Prediction](https://github.com/meliy-meyada/Colaboratory-Notebooks-ML/blob/main/ML-Notebooks/Gender_Prediction.ipynb) | Predict the gender of a person based on their voice characteristics.

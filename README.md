| List | Link | Description |
|:--|:--------|:------------|
| 1. | [Dog breed Prediction](https://github.com/meliy-meyada/Colaboratory-Notebooks-ML/blob/main/ML-Notebooks/Dog_breed_Predictions.ipynb) | Convolutional Neural Network capable of identifying the breed of a dog in a supplied image. |
| 2. | [Traffic Sign Classification](https://github.com/meliy-meyada/Colaboratory-Notebooks-ML/blob/main/ML-Notebooks/TF_Traffic_Sign_Classification.ipynb) | Convolutional Neural Network to build train and test a traffic sign classification model.  Using tensorflow and keras. It is a multiclass classification problem. |
| 3. | [Optical charactors Recognition UsingImage](https://github.com/meliy-meyada/Colaboratory-Notebooks-ML/blob/main/ML-Notebooks/Optical_charactors_recognition_using_image.ipynb) |  text from images. After extracting the text we will apply some basic functions of OpenCV on that text to enhance it and to get more accurate results. |
| 4. | [Plant Deseases Prediction](https://github.com/meliy-meyada/Colaboratory-Notebooks-ML/blob/main/ML-Notebooks/Plant_Deseases_Prediction.ipynb) | Convolutional Neural Network which will be able to predict whether a plant is suffering from a disease.|
| 5. | [Vehicle Detect Counts](https://github.com/meliy-meyada/Colaboratory-Notebooks-ML/blob/main/ML-Notebooks/Vehicle_Detect_Counts.ipynb) | Detecting and counting vehicles in a given image or a video. |
| 6. | [Face Swap](https://github.com/meliy-meyada/Colaboratory-Notebooks-ML/blob/main/ML-Notebooks/Face_Swap.ipynb) | Extract faces of human-beings from a given image. We will use a pretrained model to extract landmarks from the faces. |
